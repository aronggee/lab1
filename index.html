<p>Hi there! I am Aaron, I live in Taguig city, I’m 19 years old and I’m the youngest among my 3 siblings
 <p>I’m lazy person when it comes to household chores, but I love playing mobile games and basketball.
 I graduated Junior High School at La Immaculada Concepcion School in Pasig city and graduated Senior High School here at APC.<br>
 As an APC student since SHS, I can say APC is a good foundation for us students because first is that they do follow dress code which helps us to be comfortable in wearing corporate attire where we will always wear when we’re in a workplace.<br> Second is that their professors are expert in the field that they have chosen and they are in the industry wherein with their experience, they can teach or help us more than what teachers can do.

<p>I spent my summer vacation more on staying in the house playing mobile legends and playing basketball with my friends. I also do workout to make my body fit as well as for my own good. But I enjoyed it because I had an overnight swimming with my friends at Laguna and that night was so lit. I also love watching movies with my siblings because that’s our bonding time. They all have works and I’m the only one who’s still studying, their time are limited so every moment with them should be seized.

I expect this class to be fun and the knowledge that I will get here will be helpful for me in the future because it is aligned with my course.
